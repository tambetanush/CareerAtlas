"""
On-the-fly role taxonomy generation (council "one thing": remove the role ceiling).

The gap-analysis retrieval pipeline is already role-agnostic — it just needs
taxonomy rows for the role in Pinecone. We curated 8 tech roles by hand; for any
OTHER role (unlisted tech, or non-tech) we lazily LLM-generate ~20 skill rows in
the exact same schema, embed + upsert them tagged source="llm", and cache them
forever. This makes gap analysis work for ANY role the user types, without a
hand-built taxonomy per role.

Generated taxonomies are tagged source="llm" so they are auditable and the UI can
label them "experimental" — we never silently render them as curated truth.
ponytail: this is the lazy-generate path; grounding generation in real Adzuna
postings (higher fidelity) is the planned phase-2 quality booster.
