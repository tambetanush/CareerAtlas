"""
Deep Researcher — LLM-as-judge evaluation.

Scores a generated Pathway against a 7-criterion rubric using Groq
Llama-3.3-70b. Runs at temperature 0.0 (vs 0.2 for the structurer) and
against an explicit rubric, so it evaluates independently of how the
pathway was drafted.

Ported from Notebooks/03_deep_researcher.ipynb (cells 0dbeafe3 / 333e7081),
extended with a `recency` criterion.
